PREFATORY NOTE


These drawings are selections from Cartoons published, for the most
part, in a daily newspaper. They represent the emotions evoked by the
news from day to day, and make no pretense to a philosophic viewpoint.
They do seek to express, however, a deep conviction that Germany is
chiefly to blame for the war.

                        Boardman Robinson.

_April, 1915._
